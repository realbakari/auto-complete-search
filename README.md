# Autocomplete search, based on google search

Google Autocomplete search functionality

The search component will be split into three main sub-components
 - The search bar where the input and ion are
 - the autocomplete results
 - The buttons

 The search bar will consist of the input elements(div or button)and the microphone just for show(it scope within this project will account for it presence nonetheless).

 The autocomplete result will contain an unordered list as the sole elements. unordered list HTML case means `ul` as opposed to `ol` - ordered list.
